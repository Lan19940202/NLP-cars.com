# NLP-cars.com
#### This project is initially one of the three mini projects of Advance Business Analysis using R course. In this project, I scraped the Toyota Camry customer review data between 2012 and 2017 from cars.com, used customer review data to build a model to predict the star, and also counted the TF-IDF score for four car figures which are most concerned by customers. Also, I created a shiny App to visualize my outcome. [server.R](https://github.com/Lanwei02/NLP-cars.com/blob/master/server.R) and [ui.R](https://github.com/Lanwei02/NLP-cars.com/blob/master/ui.R) are files of the Shiny App.
